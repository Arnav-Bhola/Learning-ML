## This Repository

This repository is simply where I upload all the code for my ongoing progress learning ML.

## What Courses?

- [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python &amp; R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning)

## Note

A lot of these course files might be incomplete as I might have skipped some course lectures, used the online coding tools, tried my own things. Also, I have been learning ML over a long span of time and due of this, there might be discrepancies in the code. 

## Datasets - Notes and Credits
- In the Machine Learning A-Z course folder, I have uploaded all the datasets. This includes the large image dataset for convolutional neural networks with over 10,000 images.
